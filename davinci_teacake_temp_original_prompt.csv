My best guess is that the time interval between batches of teacakes is 35 minutes.",". Explain how you reached your conclusion.

My new best guess is that the time interval between batches of teacakes is approximately 20 minutes. This is because the times recorded over the three days (34, 8, and 21 minutes) all approximate a multiple of 20 (34 is close to 40, 8 is close to 10, and 21 is close to 20). Thus, I infer that the baker bakes a fresh batch of teacakes every 20 minutes."," Explain how you reached your conclusion.
